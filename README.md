# Student Record Management System

This project is a Java-based application designed to simulate a comprehensive student record management system. The system facilitates the management of student information, including their names, IDs, addresses, courses, departments, and modules. It provides robust functionality to add new students, retrieve detailed information about a specific student by their ID, view all student records, and update existing student details such as course names or other attributes. The program is built with a focus on object-oriented principles, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to set up and use the Student Record Management System:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed on your system.
   - Optionally, install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for easier development and debugging.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/student-record-system.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd student-record-system
     ```

3. **Compile the Code**:
   - Open a terminal in the project directory and compile the Java files:
     ```bash
     javac -d bin src/*.java
     ```
   - This will compile the source code and place the compiled `.class` files in the `bin` directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the main class to start the application:
     ```bash
     java -cp bin Main
     ```
   - Replace `Main` with the actual name of the main class if it differs.

5. **Using the Application**:
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to:
     - Add new student records.
     - Retrieve student information by ID.
     - View all student records.
     - Update existing student details.

6. **Save and Load Data** (Optional):
   - If the application includes functionality to save and load data from files, ensure you specify the correct file paths when prompted.

7. **Modify or Extend the System**:
   - To add new features or modify existing functionality, edit the source files in the `src` directory. Recompile the code after making changes.

8. **Exit the Application**:
   - Use the appropriate command or menu option to exit the application. Note that unsaved data will be lost unless explicitly saved.
